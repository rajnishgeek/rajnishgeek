I have done B.E degree in Computer Science from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology (Currently NSUT), University of Delhi. I am a software developer and computer programmer with an avid interest in Data Structures, Algorithms, Full Stack Web Development, App Development, and Optimization.

As a core programmer I love coding, and taking on challenges and love being part of the solution. I strongly believe that technology can greatly help in solving day to day problems, thereby creates a significant impact in transforming the lives of the people. I am interested in working on challenging and real-time projects.

Good Programming expertise in C/C++, Java, Python, Flutter, Dart, DBMS, Object Oriented analysis/methodologies. Enthusiastic team player, a fast learner with creative problem-solving skills, good coding, and communication skills.
